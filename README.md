# Bash utility scripts
Various bash scripts to do various things. Most are wrappers to do routine tasks where I keep forgetting basic command syntax, or to filter and prettify output of common tasks. 

Scripts are mostly slapped together with little thought, overly engineered, ham fisted, and often opnionated.   

## random-64-char-hex.sh
- Generate 24 random 64 character hex strings.
